# Project 0: AI Webpage Summarizer
 This is an intro project on learning how to use AI by creating a web page summarizer.

 ## Design
 The summarizer will ask the user a prompt where the user will insert a link to an article or any source of information and ask to summarize it. From there the front-end will send the user input 
 to the back end where it will call the LLM to generate a response to then return back to the front-end in form of 1-2 paragraphs.

 ## Tools Used
- BeautifulSoup: Webscraping articles
- Ollama gemma3 (4b): LLM used to generate responses
- React.js: Front end application
